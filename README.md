Welcome!

Thanks for stopping by!

This is a MATLAB library designed to help you apply multiscale approximation and analyze the bias ratio.

🔍 What's Included?
You’ll find three fully functional examples, no additional code or setup is needed.
Each example is located in the main folder and is named:
Plot_Graph_....m

Just run one of these scripts to get started.

📦 What This Library Implements:
    Approximation Methods:

        Moving Least Squares (MLS)

        Shepard Approximation

    Target Function Types:

        Scalar-valued functions

        Functions with values on the SPD manifold

Each approximation method is wrapped in a multiscale framework.
You can easily extend it to new target function domains by changing the inputs—no need to modify the core code.

🔗 Coming Soon:
I’ll link this library to my research paper for further reference and details.

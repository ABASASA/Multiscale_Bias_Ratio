Hey!!

Nice to have you here.
This is a Matlab library which can help you apply multiscale and the bias ratio.

You have 3 complete examples which does not need any additional code.
Those exampalse are in the main folder under the name: "Plot_Graph_....".
Just run those script.


In the future, I link it to my paper on the matter.
